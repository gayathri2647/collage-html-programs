      A butterfly is a captivating insect known for its vibrant, colorful wings
      and graceful flight. Belonging to the order Lepidoptera, butterflies
      undergo a remarkable transformation through four stages of their life
      cycle: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult. They are
      found in a wide range of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and
      gardens, thriving on nectar from flowers. Beyond their beauty, butterflies
      play a vital role in pollination, contributing to the health of
      ecosystems. Their delicate wings, often adorned with intricate patterns,
      make them a symbol of transformation, freedom, and resilience in various
      cultures around the world.
