        Butterflies are winged insects from the lepidopteran suborder
        Rhopalocera, characterized by large, often brightly coloured wings that
        often fold together when at rest, and a conspicuous, fluttering flight.
        The group comprises the superfamilies Hedyloidea (moth-butterflies in
        the Americas) and Papilionoidea (all others)

      <p>The oldest butterfly
        fossils have been dated to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago,
        though molecular evidence suggets they likely originated in the
        Cretaceous.[1] Butterflies have a four-stage life cycle, and like other
        holometabolous insects they undergo complete metamorphosis.</p>

        Winged
        adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their larvae, known as
        caterpillars, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly,
        and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is
        complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, expands
        its wings to dry, and flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the
        tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single
        generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass
        through their entire life cycle.

        Butterflies are often polymorphic,
        and many species make use of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism to
        evade their predators.[4] Some, like the monarch and the painted lady,
        migrate over long distances. Many butterflies are attacked by parasites
        or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and other
        invertebrates, or are preyed upon by other organisms. Some species are
        pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or
